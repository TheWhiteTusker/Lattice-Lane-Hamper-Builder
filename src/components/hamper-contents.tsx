/**
 * What a quote line says the client is getting.
 *
 * Detail Mode and Packaging Treatment were captured on every quote line in the
 * spreadsheet but never used - there was no printed document to use them in.
 *
 * Both are free-text pick-lists, so they are matched loosely: anything with
 * "hide" hides the contents, "summary" prints just a count, anything else
 * lists them. Packaging works the same way - "absorb" folds packaging items
 * into the hamper, anything else lists them and names the treatment.
 *
 * Rendered by both the print sheet and the quote builder, so what the client
 * will see is exactly what the person building the quote sees.
